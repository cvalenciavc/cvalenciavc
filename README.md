Hi there, my name's Claudine 👋 
*Developer × Designer × Editor*

## Right Now

- 🎓 Graduating June 2026 with Associate's in Software Development
- 🎨 I want to build web experiences that blend code, design, and storytelling.
- 📝 Publication editor (turns out obsessing over details and organizing loads of data are useful in code too)
- 💼 Looking for: Front-End Developer or UX/UI Designer roles
